## Codelist Tools

This is a Rust library for working with medical codelists (SNOMED, ICD10, OPCS). It provides fast and memory-efficient operations on medical codelists. There is a python and R interface that researchers can use.

### Structure of Project
The project is divided into two main components:

1. **rust**: The libraries written in Rust.
2. **python**: Python bindings for the Rust library.

#### Rust Library
The Rust library is a collection of modules for working with medical codelists:

- **codelists-rs**: Base library for working with codelists. This has
basic structs and functions for working with codelists. 
- **codelist-validator-rs**: Library for validating codelists. This is under development.
